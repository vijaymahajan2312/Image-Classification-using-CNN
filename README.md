# Image-Classification-using-CNN

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a subtype of Neural Networks that is mainly used for applications in image and speech recognition. Its built-in convolutional layer reduces the high dimensionality of images without losing its information. That is why CNNs are especially suited for this use case. Image Classification is the task of assigning an input image, one label from a fixed set of categories. This is one of the core problems in Computer Vision that, despite its simplicity, has a large variety of practical applications.
